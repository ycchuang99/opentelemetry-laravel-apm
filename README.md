# OpenTelemetry Laravel APM (Application Performance Management)

This repository is a reference from [blueswen/opentelemetry-apm](https://github.com/blueswen/opentelemetry-apm) and provides a Laravel package for integrating OpenTelemetry into your Laravel applications. 

## Overview

OpenTelemetry is an observability framework for cloud-native software that provides APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation to collect telemetry dataâ€”such as traces, metrics, and logsâ€”from your applications.

This package offers an example Laravel setup that demonstrates how to collect and monitor telemetry data.

## Features

- Automatic instrumentation of Laravel traces
- Metrics generation from Laravel traces by [opentelemetry-collector-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib)


## Quick Start

1. Copy .env.example to .env and update the following environment variables

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Start the application

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Run artisan commands

```shell
docker compose exec laravel php artisan key:generate
docker compose exec laravel php artisan migrate --seed
```

4. Generate test traffic with k6

```shell
docker run --rm -i -u root -v $(pwd)/k6.js:/home/k6/k6.js --net host  grafana/k6 run k6.js
```

5. Visit the [Grafana](http://localhost:8001) dashboard.

## Explain

### Laravel

1. Install the extension and enable it

    ```shell
    pecl install opentelemetry
    php --ri opentelemetry      // Verify that the extension is installed and enabled:
    ```

2. Add additional dependencies to your application, which are required for the automatic instrumentation of your code:

    ```shell
    composer require open-telemetry/opentelemetry-auto-laravel
    composer require open-telemetry/sdk
    composer require open-telemetry/exporter-otlp
    ```

    | Package | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | open-telemetry/opentelemetry-auto-laravel | Automatic instrumentation of Laravel traces |
    | open-telemetry/sdk | SDK for opentelemetry |
    | open-telemetry/exporter-otlp | OTLP exporter |

    For more dependencies, see [packagist](https://packagist.org/?query=open-telemetry)

3. Configure the OpenTelemetry SDK

    Add the following environment variables to your application's environment.

    ```php
    OTEL_PHP_AUTOLOAD_ENABLED=true
    OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=laravel-apm
    OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=deployment.environment=prod,service.version=0.0.1
    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://otel-collector:4318
    ```

### OpenTelemetry Collector

Configure the OpenTelemetry Collector by `etc/opentelemetry-collector-config.yaml`

Opentelemetry Collector will collect traces and calculate metrics from traces using the [spanmetrics connector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/connector/spanmetricsconnector/README.md).
